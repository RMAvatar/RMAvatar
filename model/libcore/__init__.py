# Notes from the author:
#   - Naming style of functions are mostly CamelCase for 
#     consistency with our internal c++ version of libcore.
#   - See the recommended naming convensions:
#     https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names
#     > mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that's 
#     > already the prevailing style (e.g. threading.py),
#     > to retain backwards compatibility.
